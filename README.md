PDF Generation Library

This Node.js library provides a RESTful API to convert plain text data into multi-page, print-ready PDF documents. 
Built with Express and PDFKit, the library efficiently generates PDFs from text content. For future expansions, additional data formats and advanced PDF formatting features can be incorporated.
